    "snippet": "With a good amount of practice of known questions, some very hard unknown DSA questions can be solved. There are well known patterns of questions and most of the questions that are asked in interviews fall into one or the other. If we do enough practice, we can easily identify the pattern and derive a solution. In this article, we will try to introduce the common patterns for solving DSA problems.Maths for codingSieve of Eratosthenes - to find the Prime Numbers\tconst int MAX = 1000000;\t// Declare a boolean array and mark all element as prime    bool[] primes = new bool[MAX + 1];    for (int i=0; i&lt;primes.Length; i++) {      primes[i] = true;    }    // Loop through a portion of the array (up to the square root of MAX).

    "snippet": "This post is to enable Page Views on the Chirpy theme based blog that you just built. This requires technical knowledge and it’s recommended to keep the google_analytics.pv.* empty unless you have a good reason. If your website has low traffic, the page views count would discourage you to write more blogs. With that said, let’s start with the setup.Set up Google AnalyticsCreate GA account and propertyFirst, you need to set up your account on Google analytics. While you create your account, you must create your first Property as well.  Head to https://analytics.google.com/ and click on Start Measuring  Enter your desired Account Name and choose the desired checkboxes  Enter your desired Property Name. This is the name of the tracker project that appears on your Google Analytics dashboard  Enter the required information About your business  Hit Create and accept any license popup to set up your Google Analytics account and create your propertyCreate Data StreamWith your property created, you now need to set up Data Stream to track your blog traffic. After you signup, the prompt should automatically take you to create your first Data Stream. If not, follow these steps:  Go to Admin on the left column  Select the desired property from the drop-down on the second column  Click on Data Streams  Add a stream and click on Web  Enter your blog’s URLIt should look like this:Now, click on the new data stream and grab the Measurement ID. It should look something like G-V6XXXXXXXX. Copy this to your _config.yml file:google_analytics:  id: 'G-V6XXXXXXX'   # fill in your Google Analytics ID  # Google Analytics pageviews report settings  pv:    proxy_endpoint:   # fill in the Google Analytics superProxy endpoint of Google App Engine    cache_path:       # the local PV cache data, friendly to visitors from GFW regionWhen you push these changes to your blog, you should start seeing the traffic on your Google Analytics. Play around with the Google Analytics dashboard to get familiar with the options available as it takes like 5 mins to pick up your changes. You should now be able to monitor your traffic in real time.Setup Page ViewsThere is a detailed tutorial available to set up Google Analytics superProxy. But, if you are interested to just quickly get your Chirpy-based blog display page views, follow along. These steps were tested on a Linux machine. If you are running Windows, you can use the Git bash terminal to run Unix-like commands.Setup Google App Engine      Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine        Click on Create Application        Click on Create Project        Enter the name and choose the data center close to you        Select Python language and Standard environment        Enable billing account. Yeah, you have to link your credit card. But, you won’t be billed unless you exceed your free quota. For a simple blog, the free quota is more than sufficient.        Go to your App Engine dashboard on your browser and select API &amp; Services from the left navigation menu        Click on Enable APIs and Services button on the top        Enable the following APIs: Google Analytics API        On the left, Click on OAuth Consent Screen and accept Configure Consent Screen. Select External since your blog is probably hosted for the public. Click on Publish under Publishing Status        Click on Credentials on the left and create a new OAuth Client IDs credential. Make sure to add an entry under Authorized redirect URIs that matches: https://&lt;project-id&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.r.appspot.com/admin/auth        Note down the Your Client ID and Your Client Secret. You’ll need this in the next section.        Download and install the cloud SDK for your platform: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart        Run the following commands:    [root@bc96abf71ef8 /]# gcloud init~snip~Go to the following link in your browser:    https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&amp;client_id=XYZ.apps.googleusercontent.com&amp;redirect_uri=ABCDEFGEnter verification code: &lt;VERIFICATION CODE THAT YOU GET AFTER YOU VISIT AND AUTHENTICATE FROM THE ABOVE LINK&gt;You are logged in as: [blah_blah@gmail.com].Pick cloud project to use:[1] chirpy-test-300716[2] Create a new projectPlease enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match listitem): 1[root@bc96abf71ef8 /]# gcloud info# Your selected project info should be displayed here      Setup Google Analytics superProxy      Clone the Google Analytics superProxy project on Github: https://github.com/googleanalytics/google-analytics-super-proxy to your local.        Remove the first 2 lines in the src/app.yaml file:    - application: your-project-id- version: 1            In src/config.py, add the OAUTH_CLIENT_ID and OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET that you gathered from your App Engine Dashboard.        Enter any random key for XSRF_KEY, your config.py should look similar to this    #!/usr/bin/python2.7__author__ = 'pete.frisella@gmail.com (Pete Frisella)'# OAuth 2.0 Client SettingsAUTH_CONFIG = {  'OAUTH_CLIENT_ID': 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',  'OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET': 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',  'OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI': '%s%s' % (    'https://chirpy-test-XXXXXX.ue.r.appspot.com',    '/admin/auth'  )}# XSRF SettingsXSRF_KEY = 'OnceUponATimeThereLivedALegend'              You can configure a custom domain instead of https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com.But, for the sake of keeping it simple, we will be using the Google provided default URL.

Add a /admin to the end of the URL.        Click on Authorize Users and make sure to add yourself as a managed user.        If you get any errors, please Google it. The errors are self-explanatory and should be easy to fix.  If everything went good, you’ll get this screen:Create Google Analytics QueryHead to https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com/admin and create a query after verifying the account. GA Core Reporting API query request can be created in Query Explorer.The query parameters are as follows:  start-date: fill in the first day of blog posting  end-date: fill in today (this is a parameter supported by GA Report, which means that it will always end according to the current query date)  metrics: select ga:pageviews  dimensions: select ga:pagePathIn order to reduce the returned results and reduce the network bandwidth, we add custom filtering rules 1:      filters: fill in ga:pagePath=~^/posts/.*/$;ga:pagePath!@=.    Among them, ; means using logical AND to concatenate two rules.    If the site.baseurl is specified, change the first filtering rule to ga:pagePath=~^/BASE_URL/posts/.*/$, where BASE_URL is the value of site.baseurl.  After Run Query, copy the generated contents of API Query URI at the bottom of the page and fill in the Encoded URI for the query of SuperProxy on GAE.After the query is saved on GAE, a Public Endpoint (public access address) will be generated, and we will get the query result in JSON format when accessing it. Finally, click Enable Endpoint in Public Request Endpoint to make the query effective, and click Start Scheduling in Scheduling to start the scheduled task.Configure Chirpy to Display Page ViewOnce all the hard part is done, it is very easy to enable the Page View on Chirpy theme. Your superProxy dashboard should look something like below and you can grab the required values.Update the _config.yml file of Chirpy project with the values from your dashboard, to look similar to the following:google_analytics:  id: 'G-V6XXXXXXX'   # fill in your Google Analytics ID  pv:    proxy_endpoint: 'https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com/query?id=&lt;ID FROM SUPER PROXY&gt;'    cache_path:       # the local PV cache data, friendly to visitors from GFW regionNow, you should see the Page View enabled on your blog.Reference            Google Analytics Core Reporting API: Filters &#8617;      "

    "snippet": "PrerequisitesFollow the instructions in the Jekyll Docs to complete the installation of Ruby, RubyGems, Jekyll, and Bundler. In addition, Git is also required to be installed.InstallationCreating a New SiteThere are two ways to create a new repository for this theme:  Using the Chirpy Starter - Easy to upgrade, isolates irrelevant project files so you can focus on writing.  Forking on GitHub - Convenient for custom development, but difficult to upgrade. Unless you are familiar with Jekyll and are determined to tweak or contribute to this project, this approach is not recommended.Option 1. Using the Chirpy StarterCreate a new repository from the Chirpy Starter and name it &lt;GH_USERNAME&gt;.github.io, where GH_USERNAME represents your GitHub username.Option 2. Forking on GitHubFork Chirpy on GitHub and rename it to &lt;GH_USERNAME&gt;.github.io. Please note that the default branch code is in development.  If you want the site to be stable, please switch to the latest tag and start writing.And then execute:$ bash tools/init.sh  If you don’t want to deploy your site on GitHub Pages, append option --no-gh at the end of the above command.The above command will:  Removes some files or directories from your repository:          .travis.yml      files under _posts            If the option --no-gh is provided, the directory .github will be deleted. Otherwise, set up the GitHub Action workflow by removing the extension .hook of .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml.hook, and then remove the other files and directories in the folder .github.        Removes item Gemfile.lock from .gitignore.    Creates a new commit to save the changes automatically.Installing DependenciesBefore running for the first time, go to the root directory of your site, and install dependencies as follows:$ bundleUsageConfigurationUpdate the variables of _config.yml as needed. Some of them are typical options:  url  avatar  timezone  langCustoming StylesheetIf you need to customize the stylesheet, copy the theme’s assets/css/style.scss to the same path on your Jekyll site, and then add the custom style at the end of the style file.Starting from v4.1.0, if you want to overwrite the SASS variables defined in _sass/addon/variables.scss, create a new file _sass/variables-hook.scss and assign new values to the target variable in it.Customing Static AssetsStatic assets configuration was introduced in version 5.1.0. The CDN of the static assets is defined by file _data/assets/cross_origin.yml, and you can replace some of them according to the network conditions in the region where your website is published.Also, if you’d like to self-host the static assets, please refer to the chirpy-static-assets.Running Local ServerYou may want to preview the site contents before publishing, so just run it by:$ bundle exec jekyll sOr run the site on Docker with the following command:$ docker run -it --rm \\    --volume=\"$PWD:/srv/jekyll\" \\    -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll \\    jekyll serveAfter a while, the local service will be published at http://127.0.0.1:4000.DeploymentBefore the deployment begins, check out the file _config.yml and make sure the url is configured correctly. Furthermore, if you prefer the project site and don’t use a custom domain, or you want to visit your website with a base URL on a web server other than GitHub Pages, remember to change the baseurl to your project name that starts with a slash, e.g, /project-name.Now you can choose ONE of the following methods to deploy your Jekyll site.Deploy by Using Github ActionsFor security reasons, GitHub Pages build runs on safe mode, which restricts us from using plugins to generate additional page files. Therefore, we can use GitHub Actions to build the site, store the built site files on a new branch, and use that branch as the source of the GitHub Pages service.Quickly check the files needed for GitHub Actions build:      Ensure your Jekyll site has the file .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml. Otherwise, create a new one and fill in the contents of the sample file, and the value of the on.push.branches should be the same as your repo’s default branch name.        Ensure your Jekyll site has file tools/deploy.sh. Otherwise, copy it from here to your Jekyll site.        Furthermore, if you have committed Gemfile.lock to the repo, and your runtime system is not Linux, don’t forget to update the platform list in the lock file:    $ bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux      After the above steps, rename your repository to &lt;GH_USERNAME&gt;.github.io on GitHub.Now publish your Jekyll site by:      Push any commit to remote to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow. Once the build is complete and successful, a new remote branch named gh-pages will appear to store the built site files.        Browse to your repository on GitHub. Select the tab Settings, then click Pages in the left navigation bar, and then in the section Source of GitHub Pages, select the /(root) directory of branch gh-pages as the publishing source. Remember to click Save before leaving.            Visit your website at the address indicated by GitHub.  Manually Build and DeployOn self-hosted servers, you cannot enjoy the convenience of GitHub Actions. Therefore, you should build the site on your local machine and then upload the site files to the server.Go to the root of the source project, and build your site as follows:$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll bOr build the site on Docker:$ docker run -it --rm \\    --env JEKYLL_ENV=production \\    --volume=\"$PWD:/srv/jekyll\" \\    jekyll/jekyll \\    jekyll buildUnless you specified the output path, the generated site files will be placed in folder _site of the project’s root directory. Now you should upload those files to the target server.UpgradingIt depends on how you use the theme:      If you are using the theme gem (there will be gem \"jekyll-theme-chirpy\" in the Gemfile), editing the Gemfile and update the version number of the theme gem, for example:    - gem \"jekyll-theme-chirpy\", \"~&gt; 3.2\", \"&gt;= 3.2.1\"+ gem \"jekyll-theme-chirpy\", \"~&gt; 3.3\", \"&gt;= 3.3.0\"        And then execute the following command:    $ bundle update jekyll-theme-chirpy        As the version upgrades, the critical files (for details, see the Startup Template) and configuration options will change. Please refer to the Upgrade Guide to keep your repo’s files in sync with the latest version of the theme.        If you forked from the source project (there will be gemspec in the Gemfile of your site), then merge the latest upstream tags into your Jekyll site to complete the upgrade.The merge is likely to conflict with your local modifications. Please be patient and careful to resolve these conflicts.  "

    "snippet": "This post will guide you how to write a post on Chirpy theme. Even if you have previous experience with Jekyll, this article is worth reading, because many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and PathCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin Jekyll-Compose to accomplish this.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG]     # TAG names should always be lowercase---  The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of DateIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post’s timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:---categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]---Author InformationThe author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the Front Matter , they will be obtained from variables social.name and the first entry of social.links of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:Add author information in _data/authors.yml (If your website doesn’t have this file, don’t hesitate to create one.)&lt;author_id&gt;:  name: &lt;full name&gt;  twitter: &lt;twitter_of_author&gt;  url: &lt;homepage_of_author&gt;And then set up the custom author in the post’s YAML block:---author: &lt;author_id&gt;---  Another benefit of reading the author information from the file _data/authors.yml is that the page will have the meta tag twitter:creator, which enriches the Twitter Cards and is good for SEO.Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsThe global switch of comments is defined by variable comments.active in the file _config.yml. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MathematicsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---MermaidMermaid is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.ImagesCaptionAdd italics to the next line of an image，then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_SizeIn order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"700\" height=\"400\" }Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, height and width support abbreviations (height → h, width → w). The following example has the same effect as the above:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w=\"700\" h=\"400\" }PositionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right.  Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added.      Normal position    Image will be left aligned in below sample:    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal }            Float to the left    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left }            Float to the right    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right }      ShadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect, and the shadow will be visible in the light mode:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }CDN URLIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN URL by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:img_cdn: https://cdn.comOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN URL will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.For instance, when using images:![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:&lt;img src=\"https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Image PathWhen a post contains many images, it will be a time-consuming task to repeatedly define the path of the images. To solve this, we can define this path in the YAML block of the post:---img_path: /img/path/---And then, the image source of Markdown can write the file name directly:![The flower](flower.png)The output will be:&lt;img src=\"/img/path/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Preview ImageIf you want to add an image to the top of the post contents, specify the attribute path, width, height, and alt for the image:---image:  path: /path/to/image/file  width: 1000   # in pixels  height: 400   # in pixels  alt: image alternative text---Except for alt, all other options are necessary, especially the width and height, which are related to user experience and web page loading performance. The above section “Size” also mentions this.Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, the attributes height and width can be abbreviated: height → h, width → w. In addition, the img_path can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the  attribute path only needs the image file name.Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---PromptsThere are several types of prompts: tip, info, warning, and danger. They can be generated by adding the class prompt-{type} to the blockquote. For example, define a prompt of type info as follows:&gt; Example line for prompt.{: .prompt-info }SyntaxInline Code`inline code part`Filepath Hightlight`/path/to/a/file.extend`{: .filepath}Code BlockMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as follows:```This is a plaintext code snippet.```Specifying LanguageUsing ```{language} you will get a code block with syntax highlight:```yamlkey: value```  The Jekyll tag {% highlight %} is not compatible with this theme.Line NumberBy default, all languages except plaintext, console, and terminal will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of a code block, add the class nolineno to it:```shellecho 'No more line numbers!'```{: .nolineno }Specifying the FilenameYou may have noticed that the code language will be displayed at the top of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute file to achieve this:```shell# content```{: file=\"path/to/file\" }Liquid CodesIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %}:{% raw %}```liquid{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %}  This product's title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}```{% endraw %}Or adding render_with_liquid: false (Requires Jekyll 4.0 or higher) to the post’s YAML block.Learn MoreFor more knowledge about Jekyll posts, visit the Jekyll Docs: Posts."
